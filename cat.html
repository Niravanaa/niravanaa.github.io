        <h2>How to Take Care of a Cat</h2>
        <p>Cats make wonderful pets, and with proper care, they can live long and healthy lives. Here are some tips on how to take care of your feline friend:</p>
        <div class="care-element">
          <h3>Food and Water</h3>
          <p>Cats need a balanced diet to stay healthy. Feed them high-quality cat food and make sure they have access to fresh water at all times. Wet food can also be added to their diet to help them stay hydrated.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="care-element">
          <h3>Litter Box</h3>
          <p>Cats are clean animals and need a clean litter box. Make sure to scoop the litter box daily and change the litter and wash the box once a week.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="care-element">
          <h3>Exercise and Play</h3>
          <p>Cats love to play and need daily exercise to stay healthy. Provide them with toys and spend time playing with them every day. You can also invest in a cat tree or scratching post to give them a place to play and exercise.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="care-element">
          <h3>Grooming</h3>
          <p>Cats groom themselves, but they may need help with long hair. Brush your cat regularly to prevent mats and tangles, and trim their nails as needed.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="care-element">
          <h3>Veterinary Care</h3>
          <p>Cats need regular check-ups with a vet. Make sure to keep their vaccinations up-to-date and schedule regular appointments for check-ups and any necessary treatments.</p>
